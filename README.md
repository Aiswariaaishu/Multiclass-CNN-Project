# Multiclass-CNN-Project<br />
Project Title: Eye Disease Classification with Deep Learning<br />

Overview: This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict eye diseases—specifically, distinguishing between Entropion, Ectropion, combined Entropion and Ectropion, and a healthy eye. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of eye images, enabling accurate classification for early detection and intervention.<br />

Key Features:<br />
Image Classification: The deep learning model can classify multiclass input eye images into one of the following categories: Entropion, Ectropion, combined Entropio and  Ectropion, or a Healthy eye.<br />
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The underlying architecture employs a CNN for feature extraction and hierarchical learning, optimizing the model's ability to discern subtle patterns indicative of different eye conditions.<br />
Data Augmentation: The dataset is enhanced through data augmentation techniques, ensuring robust model training and improved generalization to diverse eye images.<br />
Dataset: The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising a variety of eye images, carefully labeled for different conditions. The dataset includes examples of Entropion, Ectropion, combined Entropion and combined Ectropion, and Healthy eyes.<br />

Technology Stack:<br />
