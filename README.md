# Multiclass-CNN-Project\n
Project Title: Eye Disease Classification with Deep Learning\n

Overview: This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict eye diseasesâ€”specifically, distinguishing between Entropion, Ectropion, combined Entropion and Ectropion, and a healthy eye. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of eye images, enabling accurate classification for early detection and intervention.\n

Key Features:\n
Image Classification: The deep learning model can classify multiclass input eye images into one of the following categories: Entropion, Ectropion, combined Entropio and  Ectropion, or a Healthy eye.\n
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The underlying architecture employs a CNN for feature extraction and hierarchical learning, optimizing the model's ability to discern subtle patterns indicative of different eye conditions.\n
Data Augmentation: The dataset is enhanced through data augmentation techniques, ensuring robust model training and improved generalization to diverse eye images.\n
Dataset: The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising a variety of eye images, carefully labeled for different conditions. The dataset includes examples of Entropion, Ectropion, combined Entropion and combined Ectropion, and Healthy eyes.\n
